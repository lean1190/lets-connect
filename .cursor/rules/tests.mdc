# Unit and integration tests

Write tests only when asked.
Before starting to write the tests, explain what tests you will write.
Explain how are these tests meaningful, and what decisions you made.

- Tests configuration MUST be simple, easy to read and maintain.
- Tests configuration MUST use the SIFERS pattern, instead of `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks.
- Tests MUST follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Tests MUST be deterministic and flat. Do not use conditional statements in a test.
- Tests MUST verify and clearly document behavior, focusing on output, NOT implementation details.
- Tests MUST verify one thing at a time, and avoid multiple assertions in one test case.
- Tests MUST consider edge cases and error conditions.
- Tests MUST NOT rely on execution order.
- Tests MUST NOT verify trivial things like the element under test being truthy or created.
- Tests MUST NOT include comments.
- Tests MUST NOT include unused variables and imports.
